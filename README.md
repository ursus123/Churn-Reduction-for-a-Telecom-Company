# churn Reduction Model for a Telecom Company

Churn or customer attrition is a business metric that shows customers that stopped doing business or stopped using a particular service with a company.
When a customer churns it means a company has lost that customer.
By predicting which customer is going to churn can allow businesses to take appropriate actions to prevent losing a customer. **So in this project, I built a predictive churn model to see what kind of actions to take in order to reduce customer attrition.
In this project I built a churn reduction model that can help reduce churn by +5.5%**

## Data Source
Data that was used in this study is of a telecom company, it has up to 20 features with a feature called churn which tells us if a customer has churned or not. This churn feature will be our target. (https://bigml.com/user/francisco/gallery/dataset/5163ad540c0b5e5b22000383)
